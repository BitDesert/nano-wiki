RaiBlocks primary goal: to be a secure, fast, and efficient cryptocurrency.

RaiBlocks has been engineered from the ground up for fast decentralized transactions and minimal resource usage.

RaiBlocks features instant transaction confirmation and has an incredibly low energy footprint.  If you're looking for technical details please see our [[Design features]] section.

Our goal is to provide an open and interoperable framework that other systems can be built on top of.  If you're interested in writing a front-end to raiblocks like a Point of Sale, an exchange, or something else, please contact us! clemahieu@raiblocks.net or check out the source code to see if the existing api will satisfy your requirements.
