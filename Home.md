RaiBlocks primary goal: to be a secure and scalable cryptocurrency platform.

We've applied the philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well" and from the ground up we've built a system for scalability and resiliency.

RaiBlocks features instant transaction confirmation and has an incredibly low energy footprint.  If you're looking for technical details please see our [[Design features]] section.

Our goal is to provide an open and interoperable framework that other systems can build on.  If you're interested in writing a front-end to RaiBlocks like a Point of Sale, an exchange, or something else, please contact us! clemahieu@raiblocks.net or review the source code to see if the existing api will satisfy your requirements.
