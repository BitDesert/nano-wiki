Coin mining is a natural extension of proof of work cryptocurrencies in order to disseminate coins in a distributed fashion.  Mining requires a distributed agreement process and as such, is more difficult to implement in a system that focuses on eliminating distributed agreements.  The beneficiaries of mining unfortunately also tend to be skewed toward enthusiasts or those with capital investment in mining hardware.

We plan to distribute coins through a fixed distribution schedule.  Price of coins through the distribution period will be adjusted in order to follow the schedule.  If coins are being distributed too quickly price will rise and if they're being distributed too slowly, price will fall, possibly becoming free of charge.
