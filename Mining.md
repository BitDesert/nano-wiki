Coin mining is a natural extension of proof of work cryptocurrencies in order to disseminate coins in a distributed fashion.  Mining requires a distributed agreement process and as such, is more difficult to implement in a system that focuses on eliminating distributed agreements.

Mining is also used as a reward mechanism for maintaining integrity of proof of work algorithms.  There are many aspects to maintaining a full cryptocurrency including processing transactions, distributing the ledger to new peers, storage space for historical ledgers, and building software people need for accessing and using the system.  Unfortunately mining as a reward mechanism only rewards one aspect of keeping a cryptocurrency healthy, transaction processing. The beneficiaries of mining unfortunately also tend to be skewed toward enthusiasts or those with capital investment in mining hardware.  The direct monetary costs of mining are typically ignored specifically the hardware purchase cost and the ongoing energy usage cost.

We plan to distribute coins through a fixed distribution schedule coin faucet.  Coin price through the distribution period will be adjusted in order to follow the fixed distribution rate schedule.  If coins are being distributed too quickly the price will rise and if they're being distributed too slowly, the price will fall until they become free of charge.  Once the distribution period has ended the maximum supply forever will have been reached and the supply will never again increase.
