# Running a lite node  
You can run a lite node with a fixed maximum amount of disk, CPU and bandwidth.  This allows new people to get a listing of accounts more quickly while not using too many resources on your computer.

# Running an audit node  
You can run an audit node which requires much more disk space.  This allows people to do a full verification of the cryptographic integrity of the whole ledger going back to the beginning.

# Running a representative node  
If you have dedicated processing power and a reliable, persistent connection to the internet, you can run a representative node and allow people to delegate their vote strength to you so they don't need to participate in voting.  This allows conflicts in the ledger to be resolved more quickly and allows people who can't remain connected to still have their votes participate in keeping the ledger accurate.
