Nano has one blockchain for each account which is controlled by the account's private key, and each blockchain is replicated to all peers in the network. We call this arrangement a **block lattice**.

Balances are transferred between blockchains through "send" and "receive" blocks.  "Send" blocks reduce the balance of an account and marks the delta as receivable by an account number.  At a later time, the receiving account creates a "receive" block, which increases the balance of their account by the delta.

Distributed agreements like Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake are unnecessary, since the account owner has authoritative control over transactions.
